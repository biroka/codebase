# Vuex Hello World

[Full tutorial](https://flaviocopes.com/vuex/)

Vuex is the official state management library for Vue.js. Its job is to share data across the components of your application.

Components in Vue.js out of the box can communicate using:

* **props**, to pass state down to child components from a parent.
* **events**, to change the state of a parent component from a child, or using the root component as an event bus.
